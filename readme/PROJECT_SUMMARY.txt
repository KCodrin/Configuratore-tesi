Project Name: Thesis Configurator
Version: 1.3
Description: A single-page web application (SPA) for the guided configuration and printing order of university theses. The system guides the user through a 7-step process, from uploading PDF files to checkout.

Main Technology Stack:
- React 19 (with Hooks)
- TypeScript
- TailwindCSS
- pdf.js (for PDF manipulation)

User Flow:
- Step 1: Upload Thesis and Cover Page.
- Step 2: Configure paper and printing options (double-sided, etc.).
- Step 3: Select color for each individual page with automatic detection.
- Step 4: Choose binding and cover finishes with a dynamic preview.
- Step 5: Add extra options (e.g., metal corners, custom applications).
- Step 6: Final review with an interactive 3D preview (flipbook).
- Step 7: Enter billing/shipping details and payment.

Key Features:
- Modern and responsive interface.
- In-browser generation of PDF page previews.
- Real-time price estimate calculation with every selection.
- Dynamic cover preview with material textures and lamination effects.
- Automatic detection of color pages to optimize costs.
- Management of printing conflicts (e.g., double-sided).
- Final "flipbook" preview for a complete review of the product.

Data Persistence:
- The application does not require a backend.
- All user choices and configuration data are saved in the browser's `localStorage`, ensuring persistence between sessions and the transfer of information between the various steps.
